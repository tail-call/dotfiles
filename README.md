# dotfiles

*Anton Istomin <anton@tail-call.ru>*

These are dotfiles that I use on my Linux machines. Feel free to study
them, modify them, reuse their parts or use them in full.

Some of them weren't used for quite a while, so be careful. For
example, don't expect luakit config to work well immediately.

My *~/bin* directory is also included in this repo cause my workflow
heavily depends on some scripts from there. Most of them are just
funny toys though.
